  <div class="title">About Imaging FlowCytobot data</div>
  <div class="subtitle">
What you are looking at are images of phytoplankton that have been taken by an automated imaging flow cytometer. This submersible
device uses microfluidics to filter and guide seawater samples through an extremely narrow flow channel.
The cells travel single-file through this channel and past a laser beam; light scattered by the cell is detected by
a photomultiplier. When scattering and fluorescence values indicate the presence of chlorophyll, a video frame is taken
through a microscope to image the object that was detected by the photomultiplier. These objects are typically phytoplankton,
although smaller zooplankton that feed on phytoplankton can sometimes be seen, as well as various kinds of debris.
<p>
Imaging FlowCytobot is designed to operate underwater for long periods of time, connected to land via optical fiber and
power cables. It has been continuously deployed at the Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory for over six years and has
collected hundreds of millions of phytoplankton images with associated photomultiplier data.
<p>
Each mosaic that you see on the page is a visual summary of the largest objects seen by IFCB in a given 20-minute
span. This is typically only a small fraction of the ~5-10,000 images IFCB collects in that amount of time.
Mouse over each image to enlarge it and show associated data.
<p>
In the large mosaic, click on an image to see
the full-size image and its data. Each image has a URL such as:
<p>
<a href="http://ifcb-data.whoi.edu/IFCB1_2011_285_070942_01711.html">http://ifcb-data.whoi.edu/IFCB1_2011_285_070942_01711.html</a>
<p>
Which can be emailed, shared, or posted to a social network. Images also have URL's that return machine-readable
metadata in formats such as XML, JSON, and RDF. These are formed simply by using the appropriate extension, like this:
<p>
<a href="http://ifcb-data.whoi.edu/IFCB1_2011_285_070942_01711.xml">http://ifcb-data.whoi.edu/IFCB1_2011_285_070942_01711.xml</a>
<p>
<p>In the smaller mosaics, click anywhere in the mosaic to make it the large
mosaic and show earlier time spans as smaller mosaics. In effect this navigates back in time. All timestamps are
in the UTC (sometimes called GMT) timezone.
<p>
Below each mosaic is a brief description, as well as links where you can download the data associated with a bin
in CSV, XML, or RDF formats. Note that the XML and RDF formats only provide links to individual images.
<p>
Note: this application is still under development. It may take a long time for some images to load.
Please be patient.
